# EssentialFeed

Narrative #1
As an online customer
I want the app to automatically load my latest image feed
So I can always enjoy the newest images of my friends
Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)
Given the customer has connectivity
 When the customer requests to see their feed
 Then the app should display the latest feed from remote
  And replace the cache with the new feed
